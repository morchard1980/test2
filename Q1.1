this is an example of how we can add content to the file

Although this editor is designed for coding, is there any reason we cannot use it to do the kind of work that we do?  What happens when you get to the end of a line.  Because it is a coding editor I think it then indents the subsequent line, as if you were writing a for loop or function for instance.


I am now editing this file, what diffence does that make?
